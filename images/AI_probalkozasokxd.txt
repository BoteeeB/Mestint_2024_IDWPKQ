Given is a 4x4 game board as seen in figure 26, where a coin is placed on each of the four central squares. A coin can be moved vertically or horizontally by 1, 2, or 3 squares if it is at least four-neighbor with another coin, and if it lands on an empty square, and there is no other coin in the way during movement. The four coins must be moved to the four corners.

is this game even solveable?

Copilot
Yes, the game is solvable. Here‚Äôs a possible solution:

Move the top-center coin 3 squares up to the top-left corner.
Move the bottom-center coin 3 squares down to the bottom-right corner.
Move the left-center coin 3 squares left to the bottom-left corner.
Move the right-center coin 3 squares right to the top-right corner.
This way, all four coins are moved to the four corners of the board. The key is to move the coins in such a way that they don‚Äôt block the path of the other coins. Remember, a coin can only be moved if it is at least four-neighbor with another coin, and it can only land on an empty square with no other coin in the way during movement. So, the order of the moves is important. Hope this helps! üòä

Sure, here‚Äôs the game board at each step of the solution:

Initial State:

1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1

After Step 1 (Move the top-center coin 3 squares up to the top-left corner):

0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1

After Step 2 (Move the bottom-center coin 3 squares down to the bottom-right corner):

0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1

After Step 3 (Move the left-center coin 3 squares left to the bottom-left corner):

0 0 1 1
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1

After Step 4 (Move the right-center coin 3 squares right to the top-right corner):

0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1
